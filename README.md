#  Modeling, Simulation and Control of Electronic Circuits in the Application Electronics Lab (Modeling_simulation_and_control_of_elect.pdf)
This paper presents the description, properties, and use of the Electronics Lab application from Autodesk 123D Circuits for modeling and simulation of electrical and electronic circuits in technical systems. It demonstrates the use of Electronics Lab in teaching electrical installations and digital electronics, with its integration of the Arduino platform for programming and control of models such as LEDs, traffic lights, and displays in real time. The application is highlighted for its simplicity, free availability, and interactive learning environment.


#  Digital Circuit Simulator Project at Undergraduate Level (digital_circuit_simulator_project.pdf)
This paper discusses various aspects of student learning based on a project to develop a primitive digital electronic circuit simulator at the undergraduate level within the Computer Engineering program at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, PA. The project exposes students to language compilation, circuit database schemes, and simulation techniques. Students learn to use a simple text-based grammar to describe logic circuits, compile them, and run simulations. The paper includes a student survey about the project experience and concludes with reflections on learning objectives, implementation, and future plans. Keywords include digital electronic, logic circuit, simulation, and project-based learning.


#  Platform for Hands-on Remote Labs Based on the ESP32 and NOD-red (Platform for hands-on remote labs based on the ESP32 and NOD-red.pdf)
This study describes a low-cost remote laboratory platform called LABERSIME, developed at the Superior School of Technology of Agadir, Morocco, and based on the ESP32 and Node-RED. The platform enables practical work for students in scientific and technical training through remote control, monitoring, and data acquisition via open-source hardware. The platform is designed for cloud deployment and offers hands-on experiences that support student motivation and learning efficiency, particularly relevant during pandemic-driven educational disruption. The article details architecture, implementation, and results from student satisfaction surveys, confirming the platformâ€™s utility as a complement to classical laboratory work.
