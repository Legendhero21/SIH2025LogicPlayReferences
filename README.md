#  Modeling, Simulation and Control of Electronic Circuits in the Application Electronics Lab (Modeling_simulation_and_control_of_elect.pdf)
This paper presents the description, properties, and use of the Electronics Lab application from Autodesk 123D Circuits for modeling and simulation of electrical and electronic circuits in technical systems. It demonstrates the use of Electronics Lab in teaching electrical installations and digital electronics, with its integration of the Arduino platform for programming and control of models such as LEDs, traffic lights, and displays in real time. The application is highlighted for its simplicity, free availability, and interactive learning environment.


#  Digital Circuit Simulator Project at Undergraduate Level (digital_circuit_simulator_project.pdf)
This paper discusses various aspects of student learning based on a project to develop a primitive digital electronic circuit simulator at the undergraduate level within the Computer Engineering program at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, PA. The project exposes students to language compilation, circuit database schemes, and simulation techniques. Students learn to use a simple text-based grammar to describe logic circuits, compile them, and run simulations. The paper includes a student survey about the project experience and concludes with reflections on learning objectives, implementation, and future plans. Keywords include digital electronic, logic circuit, simulation, and project-based learning.


#  Platform for Hands-on Remote Labs Based on the ESP32 and NOD-red (Platform for hands-on remote labs based on the ESP32 and NOD-red.pdf)
This study describes a low-cost remote laboratory platform called LABERSIME, developed at the Superior School of Technology of Agadir, Morocco, and based on the ESP32 and Node-RED. The platform enables practical work for students in scientific and technical training through remote control, monitoring, and data acquisition via open-source hardware. The platform is designed for cloud deployment and offers hands-on experiences that support student motivation and learning efficiency, particularly relevant during pandemic-driven educational disruption. The article details architecture, implementation, and results from student satisfaction surveys, confirming the platformâ€™s utility as a complement to classical laboratory work.


# A Case Study for Comparing the Effectiveness of a Computer Simulation and a Hands-On Activity on Learning Electric Circuits
This paper presents a case study comparing the effectiveness of computer-based simulation and hands-on instructional activities on learning electric circuits among pre-service science and mathematics teachers. The study found that both methods significantly improved students' understanding of electric circuits, with no significant difference in learning gains between the two groups. However, the hands-on group demonstrated more group interaction and task-related discussions, indicating higher engagement. The study suggests that both approaches can be effective when used appropriately in the classroom, with potential complementary affordances depending on instructional goals and context.

# A Recent Survey of Circuit Design Tools for Teaching
This survey paper reviews various digital design tools used for teaching digital logic and computer architecture in higher education. It highlights the importance of connecting theoretical digital logic concepts with practical experience. The paper discusses different types of simulators and hardware trainer kits, including commercial and open-source tools, evaluating their usability, affordability, and educational effectiveness. The study emphasizes the significance of hands-on simulation tools in improving student learning, recommending active integration of simulators in teaching practices.

# Effectiveness of Virtual Laboratory in Engineering Education: A Meta-Analysis
This meta-analysis investigates the impact of virtual laboratories on engineering education by analyzing 46 studies from 22 publications involving controlled experiments and pre-post designs. The results show virtual labs significantly enhance engineering education outcomes, particularly in learning motivation and engagement, though they currently cannot fully replace hands-on labs. The study discusses virtual labs' benefits in accessibility, cost reduction, and fostering active learning, concluding that integrating virtual with physical labs is an effective strategy for improving engineering education.
